# Game Project

## Overview
This is a full-stack TypeScript application, likely a web-based game, with a frontend built using Vite and a backend powered by Node.js. The project uses modern tools and practices for development and deployment, ensuring a robust and maintainable codebase.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Deployment**: Netlify (configured via `netlify.toml`)
- **Shared Types**: TypeScript type definitions in `types/`

## Folder Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- **`app/`**: Contains the main frontend application code, written in TypeScript and built using Vite.
- **`server/`**: Holds the backend code, likely written in Node.js, handling server-side logic such as game state management or API endpoints.
- **`public/`**: Stores static assets (e.g., images, fonts) that are served as-is without processing by the build tool.
- **`types/`**: Includes shared TypeScript type definitions, ensuring consistency between frontend and backend code.
- **`.vscode/`**: Contains configuration files for Visual Studio Code to enhance the development experience.
- **`.env.example`**: A template for environment variables. Copy this to `.env` and fill in the required values (e.g., API keys, database URLs).
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git (e.g., `.env`, `node_modules/`).
- **`.nvmrc`**: Specifies the Node.js version to use for consistency across development environments.
- **`SECURITY.md`**: Outlines security policies and provides contact information for reporting vulnerabilities.
- **`ideas.md`**: A file for documenting feature ideas, bugs, or other development notes.
- **`index.html`**: The entry point for the frontend application, served by Vite.
- **`netlify.toml`**: Configuration file for deploying the project on Netlify.
- **`package.json` & `package-lock.json`**: Manage project dependencies and ensure consistent installations.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: Configures TypeScript compiler options for the project.
- **`vite.config.ts`**: Contains Vite configuration, such as plugins and build options.

## Setup
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OpenMindS-IT-Lab/game.git
   cd game
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Open `.env` and fill in the required values (e.g., API keys, database URLs).

4. **Ensure the correct Node.js version**:
   - The project uses the Node.js version specified in `.nvmrc`. If you have NVM installed, run:
     ```bash
     nvm use
     ```
   - If you donâ€™t have NVM, ensure your Node.js version matches the one in `.nvmrc`.

5. **Start the development server**:
   - To start both the frontend and backend (if applicable), use the appropriate npm script. For example:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - If the project has separate scripts for frontend and backend, refer to `package.json` for the correct commands.

## Deployment
The project is configured for deployment on Netlify:
- Update `netlify.toml` if needed to adjust deployment settings.
- Deploy using the Netlify CLI or by connecting the repository to Netlify via Git integration.

For more details, refer to the [Netlify documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/).
